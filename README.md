# HTML and CSS Projects
 This is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS.

Projects
One-page Website - Irish Tours - my first website created using HTML with embed youtube video.

Academy Cinema - example home page of cinema in Portland - styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.

Space Station - example page of something what companies will be able offer in the near future - space travel. Styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form. 

Portfolio Website - introduction page of myself. Created using HTML and CSS. Contains sample of two projects, Contact form, links to github and linedin profile. 

So far only four but there will be more :)
